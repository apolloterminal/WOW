  <h2 class="headers" id="history">My Raid History</h2>
  <p>
    I started playing WOW half-way through 8.3. Ended 7/12 in Mythic Nyalotha on Mistweaver.
    Applicable Logs: 
  <a href='https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/id/55053402?zone=24#metric=hps'>https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/id/55053402?zone=24#metric=hp</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    In 9.1 I joined a new guild as healer lead, swapped from Mistweaver to Restoration Shaman. Guild disbanded due to roster boss at 4/10M. Helped some friends get 5/10 with their group and didn't seek a raid guild for the rest of the tier.
  </p>
  In 9.2 I joined a guild that I believed had CE potential, @ 5/10M I gave up my raid spot because I had a college course get cancelled and had to join a new course in order to graduate, that course conflicted with raid time. Guild got CE in 9.2 but I didn't raid beyound 5/10. (Shoulda-Coulda-Really-Wish-I-Woulda). Applicable Logs: 
  <a href='https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/id/60563465#zone=28&metric=hps'>https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/id/60563465#zone=28&metric=hps</a>
  
  <p>
    Did not play in 9.3
  </p>
  <p>
    Did not play in 9.4
  </p>
  <p>
    Current 10.1: I am seeking one or two guilds to Raid with seeking CE. I have played Rsham, Hpal, MW in mythic raid content. I picked up Rdruid, Holy, Disc in 9.1. Evoker I will probably only do some M+ on. Not looking for any sorta of guild/raid leadership but I do enjoy a good planning session.
  I do Mythic Raiding / Mid-High M+ / PvP
